Cephalopods
**We could not find any references about the evolution of one or two skin layers in cephalopods or other animals that Michael asks Richard about. This could be due to the lack of fossils that we could study and also the fact that cephalopods evolved in Cambrian period (540 million years ago).

Blue colour in nature:
*Michael would like to clarify in here that of course in nature there are blue pigments and colours. What he specifically meant here is that colour blue is very rare in the animal kingdom and often it is some physical property of the surface of the plant or animal surface that causes a reflection of specific light wavelengths. Of course, there are a lot of synthetic blue molecules but in here Michael was mostly talking about pigments that occur in plants and animals.
